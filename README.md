# 👋 Hi, I'm Asilhan

## 💻 Full Stack Developer | Python & .NET (ASP.NET Core)

I am a Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in backend and web application development using Python and .NET (C#).  
I focus on building scalable, maintainable, and data-driven software solutions using clean architecture and modular code design.

I have strong knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP) and full stack web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.  
My backend experience includes ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework, and I have worked with relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle SQL, and PL/SQL.

I also have a background in system analysis, UML diagramming, and software architecture fundamentals, with a strong focus on user experience and data security.  
I am familiar with Agile methodologies and collaborative development workflows and I am seeking opportunities as a Full Stack Developer or Backend Developer, with a strong interest in data-driven systems and applied Data Science.
